# Kitty Run

This is just a little project that I created to teach my kids how to make javascript games with Phaser. It's intended for the user to follow along with `instructions.md` in vs code (or some other IDE with a markdown viewer) and update `index.html` as they go. Intermediate steps have their own pages labeled `index1` through `index12`. `index13` contains some extra features.

The graphics are from https://toffeecraft.itch.io/cat-pack. I donated to the project and if you intend to use this for anything other than just learning from this tutorial I recommend making a donation as well. You can download the entire package and change the theme and characters as an exercise.
